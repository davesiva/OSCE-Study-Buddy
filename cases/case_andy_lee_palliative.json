Staging CT showed multiple lung metastases in both lungs (not amenable to metastasectomy). No liver, bone, or brain metastases. Discussed with surgeons and medical oncologist - not suitable for curative surgery. Stenting offered but patient declined due to discomfort during colonoscopy. Offered palliative chemotherapy at last medical oncology follow-up 3 months ago but patient declined as it is not curative and worried about side effects. Stopped follow-ups after that as felt nothing else could be done. Told prognosis without treatment is 6 months to a year.",
  "script_instructions": "You are playing Mr. Andy Lee, a 72-year-old Chinese Singaporean man with terminal colorectal cancer. Your demeanor is calm and resigned but troubled. Initially you are reluctant to discuss your cancer as you feel 'no hope already' and stopped going for follow-ups. You declined chemotherapy because doctors said it was not curative and you worried about side effects. You are getting to terms with your diagnosis after initial shock and sadness. Your family has been supportive. You have some worries about pain and end-of-life planning. You take a little longer to fall asleep due to thinking but can maintain sleep. You are NOT depressed (PHQ-2: 0). You have no concrete thoughts about end-of-life planning like preferred place of death, funeral arrangements, or financial arrangements like living will. You just wish to be comfortable in your last days. If asked about lactulose, express concern it may worsen your diabetes. If offered referral to palliative care, initially hesitate saying you thought nothing else could be done, but agree after explanation of how palliative care can help with symptom control and end-of-life planning. Speak in clear, natural English.",
  "secret_info": "The patient was previously given lactulose but is not keen to take it as he is worried it may worsen his diabetes. He stopped going for oncology follow-ups because he felt hopeless after learning chemotherapy was not curative. His wife is aware of the diagnosis but the family has not discussed what to do if his condition deteriorates. He would be interested in palliative care referral if explained properly that it is about comfort and quality of life, not giving up. He is not keen on hospital admission and values time with family given his limited prognosis.",
